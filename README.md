# Sudoku-Solver
The Sudoku Solver project aims to create a program that can solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently. Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without any repetition.
